Description: Simulate real and complex numbers from distributions of their
       magnitude and arguments. Optionally, the magnitudes and/or arguments may
       be fixed in almost arbitrary ways. Plot density and distribution
       functions with automatic selection of suitable regions.  Small programming
       utilities: check if an object is identical to NA, count positional
       arguments in a call, set intersection of more than two sets, check if an
       argument is unnamed, compute the graph of S4 classes in packages.
