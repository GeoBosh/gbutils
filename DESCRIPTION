Description: Plot density and distribution functions with automatic selection of
       suitable regions. Numerically invert (compute quantiles) distribution
       functions. Simulate real and complex numbers from distributions of their
       magnitude and arguments. Optionally, the magnitudes and/or arguments may
       be fixed in almost arbitrary ways. Small programming utilities: check if
       an object is identical to NA, count positional arguments in a call, set
       intersection of more than two sets, check if an argument is unnamed,
       compute the graph of S4 classes in packages.
