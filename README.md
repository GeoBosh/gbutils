Simulate real and complex numbers from distributions of their magnitude and
arguments. Optionally, the magnitudes and/or arguments may be fixed in almost arbitrary
ways. Plot density and distribution functions with automatic selection of suitable regions.
Small programming utilities: check if an object is identical to NA, count positional
arguments in a call, set intersection of more than two sets, check if an argument is unnamed.
